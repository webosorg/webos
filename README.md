## Motivation

Web unlike the rest of programming areas has a big advantage. It supposes to introduce your product to whole world but the same time it doesn’t require to download any additional application or program. You give only the URl and  that's all. This model is quite attractive for users and for business despite its several defects. I guess that the so-called market in recent years has contributed to the development of this direction which has increased requirements of users for the web applications.
Web developers trying to satisfy all users requirements and have done their **bests at browser side**. Browser’s developers themselves have improved browsers trying to satisfy both web developers and all users. 
Today Web technology is the **powerful tool** and there are many reasons for that:
   - Suitable for business
   - Suitable for users
   - Growth of market requirements
   - IT grands like Google, Facebook want to **conquer the world**
   - Endless technical race of browsers etc..

The aim of this project is to combine all modern and newest features in one place and show this by the OS imitation.
